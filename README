This is a Hot Rod ruby client for JBoss Infinispan Data Grid Solution.

It is in development and only GET and PUT opeations are working with some limitations:
* Just default cache
* I haven't test it that much
* More to come :)

How to use it?
Look at spec/remotecache_spec.rb :P

Note:
1) First start a HotRod Server module of Infinispan (./startServer.sh -r hotrod)

* Support cache names (needs to be decided by Infinispan Team)
* Add ping operation before any call
* Validate response headers
* Add Remaining operations
